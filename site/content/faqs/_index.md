### What does an alderman even do?

Well, the term “alderman” comes from the Old English title of ealdorman, which means "elder man" or "older man"—so it’s a title in need of an update! Thirty percent of alderpeople in Chicago are women. In Chicago, an alderperson is one 50 elected officials who represent a district that contains 2 percent of the city’s residents—in Chicago we call these districts wards. The council is a legislative body, but alderfolks do more than vote on legislation. When something goes wrong on your block, like a pothole needs fixing, or when someone wants to get something done that requires city approval, like a new street sign or sidewalk cafe permit; the first step is often a call to the alder’s office.

Regardless of the size of his or her ward, aldermen and alderwomen get allotment from the city of more than $1.3 million each year—known as menu money—to spend on improvement projects in their ward, like repaving roads, replacing traffic signals, planting new trees, bring in new neighborhood art installations and more.

Aside from “ward nights”—an unofficial tradition where some aldermen host first-come-first serve office hours on a given date and time in the ward each week—all 50 aldermen meet once a month at City Hall in downtown Chicago to vote on mayoral and aldermanic agendas, from the city’s annual budget to [plans for banning (and reinstating) pigeon racing](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-met-chicago-legalize-pigeon-racing-20180628-story.html) in the city.

Aldermanic salaries are between $106,392 to $117,832.92 a year, according [the city of Chicago’s salary database](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Current-Employee-Names-Salaries-and-Position-Title/aned-ke5c).

### How did you make this list?

Chicago has a [long history of public corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Illinois#Chicago_aldermen)—some would say criminality is “[astonishingly common](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/12/chicagos-political-system-is-set-up-to-produce-corruption)” among our elected officials—but we’re only looking at federal indictments and criminal charges involving an alderman in office or running for office during the 2019 municipal election.

### What does getting indicted mean?

An [indictment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indictment) formally charges a person with a criminal offense. The indictment enables government prosecution of a suspected criminal for the offenses charged in the indictment. During an indictment proceeding, a [grand jury](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/grand_jury) determines that there is adequate basis for bringing criminal charges against a suspected criminal actor.

### What is a criminal charge?

A [criminal charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_charge) is a formal accusation made by a governmental authority (usually a public prosecutor or the police) asserting that somebody has committed a crime. The charging document is what generally starts a criminal case in court. But the procedure by which somebody is charged with a crime and what happens when somebody has been charged varies from state to state. A charge is not a verdict—before a person is proven guilty, the charge must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

### What can I do next?
