“So did we land the, uh, the tuna?” Burke’s now infamous words, ripped from the pages of his May 30 indictment, read like words left on the cutting board of the Godfather III. Chicago’s longest-serving alderman pleaded “not guilty” to federal charges of bribery and racketeering, a law first devised decades ago to combat mobsters and organized crime. All was revealed in a [59-page federal indictment](https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/article/file-attachments/20559263-0--26948.pdf) “filled with detailed allegations of classic Chicago graft,” [according to the Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/5/30/18646020/chicago-alderman-edward-burke-indictment). 

For those keeping score, Burke’s tuna line was spoken via phone to Alderman Danny Solis (TK) who shocked the city when it was revealed he had [been cooperating with an FBI investigation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-chicago-politicians-react-solis-burke-20190129-story.html#nt=instory-link) into City Hall corruption for at least two years.
