According to allegations in a federal court affidavit obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times, Alderman Danny Solis received sex acts, Viagra, free weekend use of an Indiana farm once owned by Oprah Winfrey and a steady stream of campaign contributions in exchange for shepherding official City Council actions. Solis hasn’t been charged *yet* but the jury is still out, figuratively speaking. In January 2019, it was revealed that the retired alderman—and former chair of the City Council’s powerful Zoning Committee—was a federal informant in a wide-ranging investigation that snared at least one Chicago alderman and produced recordings on another powerful Illinois politician, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, Michael Madigan. Two days after announcing his retirement, [Solis appeared on “Chicago Tonight,”](https://news.wttw.com/2018/11/26/after-23-years-city-council-ald-solis-not-seeking-re-election) to talk shop, the Chicago Way.

“I think Ald. Burke should reconsider [re-election],” Solis said on the WTTW program. “You got money, you got a great family, you got grandkids. Why do you want to run?”

Burke responded in January in a comment to [The Daily Line](http://thedailyline.net/subscriber-home/): “I have done nothing wrong. No recording that Danny Solis could make would change that.”
