According to allegations in [a federal court affidavit], former Alderman Danny Solis received Viagra, sex acts, free weekend use of an Indiana farm once owned by Oprah Winfrey and campaign contributions in exchange for shepherding official City Council actions the Chicago Way.

Solis hasn’t been charged *yet* but the jury is still out, figuratively speaking. In January 2019, it was revealed that the retired alderman—and former chair of the City Council’s powerful Zoning Committee—was a federal informant in a wide-ranging investigation that [snared at least one Chicago politician, Alderman Ed Burke](http://thedailyline.net/subscriber-home/), and produced recordings on another powerful Illinois heavy-weight, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, Michael Madigan.
