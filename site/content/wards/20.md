Alderman Willie Cochran was sentenced to one year plus one day in prison on June 24, 2019 after—much—speculation on whether he would resign his post. Cochran pleaded guilty March 21 to one count of felony wire fraud for misusing his ward’s charity funds “[meant for poor children and seniors](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-alderman-willie-cochran-indicted-20161214-story.html)” in his ward to pay for gambling and other personal expenses, according to the Chicago Tribune. [After reaching a plea deal](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/06/24/willie-cochran-sentencing-wire-fraud-corruption-charges/) with federal prosecutors, 14 of the 15 counts against him were dropped. Had he been tried on all 15 counts he could have secured himself up to 10 years in prison if convicted on all counts at trial.
