Alderman Willie Cochran was sentenced to one year plus one day in prison on June 24, 2019 after—much—speculation on whether he would resign his post. Cochran [pleaded guilty March 21](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/another-chicago-alderman-pleads-guilty-to-corruption-charges/) to one count of felony wire fraud for misusing his ward’s charity fund to pay for gambling and other personal expenses, according to the Chicago Tribune. After reaching a [plea deal](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/another-chicago-alderman-pleads-guilty-to-corruption-charges/) with federal prosecutors, 14 of the 15 counts against him were dropped.

Cochran was undeniably cut a deal, had he been tried on all 15 counts he could have secured himself up to 10 years in prison if convicted on all counts at trial.
