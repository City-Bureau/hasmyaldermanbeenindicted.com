Former Alderman Proco “Joe” Moreno was arrested in May 2019, amid [an already awful week](https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/02/26/shell-1st-ward-proco-joe-moreno/), following a re-election loss to challenger Daniel La Spata in February. The “[hipster-alderman](https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150807/east-village/proco-joe-morenos-favorite-hipster-bars/)” appeared at Chicago’s Cook County Courthouse June 4 to account for felony charges of insurance fraud, false report of a stolen car, disorderly conduct and obstruction of justice, according to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office. 

TL;DR: Moreno [let a woman he was dating get arrested in the luxury car he loaned her after falsely reporting the car stolen from his garage](https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/05/15/ald-proco-joe-moreno-told-cops-someone-stole-his-audi-but-they-say-he-loaned-it-to-woman-he-was-dating/).
