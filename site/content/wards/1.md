Two-term Moreno was arrested in May 2019 amid [an already awful week](https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/02/26/shell-1st-ward-proco-joe-moreno/)—later losing his  job to challenger Daniel La Spata. Moreno appeared at Chicago’s Cook County Courthouse June 4 to account for a felony indictment alleging [he let a woman he was dating get arrested in the luxury car he loaned her after falsely reporting the car stolen from his garage](https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/05/15/ald-proco-joe-moreno-told-cops-someone-stole-his-audi-but-they-say-he-loaned-it-to-woman-he-was-dating/).

The indictment against the former alderman includes felony charges of insurance fraud, false report of a stolen car, disorderly conduct and obstruction of justice, according to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office. Adding insult to injury, Moreno’s namesake “Croco Joe” recently lost [Block Club Chicago’s naming contest](https://twitter.com/BlockClubCHI/status/1149031916039004163) for the Humboldt Park Lagoon alligator to “Chance the Snapper.”
