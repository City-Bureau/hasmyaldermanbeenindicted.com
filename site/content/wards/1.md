Former Alderman Proco “Joe” Moreno was arrested in May 2019, [amid an already awful few months](https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/02/26/shell-1st-ward-proco-joe-moreno/), following a re-election loss to challenger Daniel La Spata in February. The “[hipster alderman](https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150807/east-village/proco-joe-morenos-favorite-hipster-bars/)” faced felony charges of insurance fraud, false report of a stolen car, disorderly conduct and obstruction of justice, according to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office. Prosecutors said Moreno let a woman he was dating get arrested in the luxury car he allegedly loaned her after reporting the car stolen from his garage. It wasn’t the end of Moreno’s legal troubles: He was charged with a DUI in late 2020.
