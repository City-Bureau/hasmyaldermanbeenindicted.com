While Austin, who is second in seniority after Alderman Edward M. Burke (14th), has not been charged with any crimes, federal agents left her office with boxes of records and at least one computer, [according to the Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2019/6/21/18700573/chicago-alderman-carrie-austin-denies-wrongdoing-fbi-raid). Austinâ€™s ward was raided June 19 in an investigation widely assumed to be connected with a federal indictment of Alderman Ed Burke, following revelation of Alderman Danny Solis as a federal informant in the case.

Though she has denied any wrongdoing, the former Chairman of the Budget Committee was replaced in that influential position when newly-elected Mayor Lori Lightfoot replaced her with Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd).
