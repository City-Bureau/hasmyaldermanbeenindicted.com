Alderman Carrie Austin has not been charged with any crimes but federal agents left her office with boxes of records and at least one computer [during a June raid](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2019/6/21/18700573/chicago-alderman-carrie-austin-denies-wrongdoing-fbi-raid) widely assumed to be connected with a federal indictment of Alderman Ed Burke, following revelation of Alderman Danny Solis as a federal informant in the case. However, in June, Crain’s Chicago Business reported that Austin’s [use of campaign money](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/greg-hinz-politics/what-are-feds-looking-carrie-austins-office-some-clues-emerge) as chairwoman of the influential City Council Budget Committee is the suspected focus of her investigation. In 2018, Austin’s committee [blew past its annual budget by $352,629](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2019/7/8/20686565/carrie-austin-budget-committee-city-council-audit-34th-ward).

Though she has denied any wrongdoing, Austin, who is second in seniority after Alderman Ed Burke (14th), was replaced as Budget Committee chair when newly-elected Mayor Lori Lightfoot installed Alderman Pat Dowell (3rd) in her place.
