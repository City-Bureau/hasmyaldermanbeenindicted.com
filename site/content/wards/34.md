Alderman Carrie Austin was [indicted](https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/07/01/ald-carrie-austin-and-her-chief-of-staff-indicted-accused-of-conspiring-to-take-bribes-from-contractors) on one count of bribery and one count of lying to the FBI in July 2021. The feds allege that Austin, a longtime alderman — second in seniority to Ald. Ed Burke [(also facing corruption charges)](https://hasmyaldermanbeenindicted.com/wards/14/) — accepted home improvements, furniture and appliances for her home from construction contractors who later received city funding for a $50 million development project in her Far South Side ward. Her chief of staff, Chester Wilson Jr., was charged on the same day. According to the indictment, the contractor told Wilson, “you help me a lot, and I’ll help you.”

For those watching the alderman indictment beat, this might not come as a surprise after federal agents raided Austin’s office in [June 2019](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2019/6/21/18700573/chicago-alderman-carrie-austin-denies-wrongdoing-fbi-raid). Though she has denied any wrongdoing at the time, apparently this was the day that she lied to the FBI, saying she [didn’t receive anything](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2021/7/1/22559792/ald-carrie-austin-chief-of-staff-bribery-federal-indictment) from the developer other than cake.
