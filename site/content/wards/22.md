Former Alderman Ricardo Muñoz was charged with fraud on April 29, 2021, two years after leaving office. The federal indictment [alleges](https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2021/4/29/22410631/former-alderman-ricardo-munoz-charged-federal-indictment-relative-college-tuition?utm_campaign=chicago.suntimes&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) that he used money from a political fund to pay for personal expenses such as a relative's college tuition, jewelry, clothing, cellphones, vacations, sports tickets and airline tickets.

Muñoz represented the 22nd ward from 1993 to 2019, when he chose not to run for re-election after an alleged 2019 New Year’s Eve altercation with his wife, who subsequently filed for divorce. Muñoz checked himself into a rehabilitation facility in January and was [found not guilty](https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2019/6/27/18761720/chicago-alderman-ricardo-munoz-not-guilty-misdemeanor-domestic-battery) of domestic battery charges later that year.
