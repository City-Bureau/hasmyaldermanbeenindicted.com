Alderman Patrick Daley Thompson—not [that Daley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Daley), or [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Daley)—was charged on April 29, 2021 with making false statements and filing a false income-tax return. According to [the Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/4/29/22409827/patrick-daley-thompson-pensacola-place-scotland-yard-washington-federal-bank-savings), the nephew and grandson of former mayors Richard M. and Richard J. Daley is “the highest-profile figure to face criminal charges involving a Bridgeport bank shut down over what authorities say was a massive fraud scheme.”

Thompson, 51, faces prosecution on seven charges involving the now-shuttered Bridgeport-based Washington Federal Bank for Savings. He’s been alderman of the 11th Ward since 2015, after a race in which, “observers noted Thompson’s jowly, blue-eyed resemblance to his grandfather, a connection bolstered by the fact he owns the Bridgeport bungalow that his grandfather Richard J. Daley lived in,” according to [the Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-alderman-patrick-daley-thompson-federal-probe-20210429-j5euehymabc7djhc4xhm2fdrau-story.html).
